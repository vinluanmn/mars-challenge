<h2>Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News</h2>
<ul><li>Open the Jupyter Notebook in the starter code folder named part_1_mars_news.ipynb.</li>
<li>Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website.</li>
<li>Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles that you scraped. Store the scraping results in Python data structures as follows: store each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary and, give each dictionary two keys: title and preview.</li></ul>

Part 2: Mars Weather Data Scraping and Analysis
<ul><li>Created a Beautiful Soup object to scrape the data in the HTML table.</li>
<li>Assembled the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame with appropriate column headings.</li>
<li>Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame. The columns should have the same headings as the table on the website. Hereâ€™s an explanation of the column headings:</li>
<p>id: the identification number of a single transmission from the Curiosity rover</p>
<p>terrestrial_date: the date on Earth</p>
<p>sol: the number of elapsed sols (Martian days) since Curiosity landed on Mars</p>
<p>s: the solar longitude</p>
<p>month: the Martian month</p>
<p>min_temp: the minimum temperature, in Celsius, of a single Martian day (sol)</p>
<p>pressure: The atmospheric pressure at Curiosity's location</p>
<li>Examine the data types that are currently associated with each column. If necessary, cast (or convert) the data to the appropriate datetime, int, or float data types.</li></ul>
